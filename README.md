# Houdini Engine for Clarisse
Houdini Engine integration for Isotropix Clarisse

This is a prototype that we whipped up while trying out Clarisse at Luma.  It is not production tested and may need to be updated to work with the latest Clarisse API, but it should provide some great example code for anyone looking to develop with either of these platforms.  Enjoy!
